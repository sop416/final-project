#summary
This map displays information about highway funding from the FAST (fixing America's surface transportation) act by state. The graduated circles represent the amount of money each state was allocated to spend on each person in that state for the construction and maintenance of the roads. This is also known as the per capita cost. If you click on the circles the per capita cost will be displayed as well as the amount of money congress allocated to each state and the amount of money each state has received.

#Objective
The objective of this map is to display the correlation of road cost per capita with the state's population. The smaller the state population the higher the cost is per capita especially if that state has a lot of land and a low population density. However there is a correlation it is not a strong one because New Jersey is the most densely populated state in the USA, spends $5.67 dollars more per capita than Arizona. Arizona  has 2,137,492 less people living in it then New Jersey. Arizona is also third-teen bigger the New Jersey.
